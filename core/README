Mule is a Python package providing an interface to the Fields Files and 
Fields File Variants used by the Met Office Unified Model (UM) as data and metadata
inputs and outputs.

The UM Documentation paper F3 provides the specification for these data formats.

Mule provides read and write access to the headers and data for these Files and 
representations of these in memory.

to run the tests, you can use
python -m unittest discover -v mule.tests
