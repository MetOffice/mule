Mule is a Python package providing an interface to the various files used 
and produced by the Met Office Unified Model (UM).

This "um_packing" module provides a Python extension to a shared UM packing
library, which Mule can optionally make use of (the library is obtainable via
a UM license and must be installed separately).

Installation
============
After installing the UM packing library this module can be installed in two 
steps.  The first step is to build the extension; you must link against the
library here, here we setup a variable to store the path:

    DIR=/path/to/the/um/packing/library

(Note that the above path is the one containing the "include" and "lib" 
subdirectories...)

Then build the extension:

    python setup.py build_ext -I$DIR/include -L$DIR/lib -lum_packing -R$DIR/lib

One the extension has been built it can be installed:

    python setup.py build 
    python setup.py install

The python setuptools methodology used here supports a variety of additional 
options which you can use to customise the install process, including the
location of the installed files.  Please consult the setuptools documentation
for further information.

Testing
=======
Once installed you can test the library with the following command:

python -m unittest um_packing.tests.test_packing

This should run 3 tests which will ensure the library is working.

Other configuration
===================
The UM packing library supports OpenMP - if it was compiled with OpenMP support
enabled you may control the number of threads the library uses by setting the
environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS.  (The Mule module which imports this
library defaults this variable to "1" for safety).

API Documentation
=================
Since the extension only exposes a few simple functions please refer to the 
docstrings for the exposed functions (which will be repeated below):

    um_packing.wgdos_pack(...)
        Pack a UM field using WGDOS packing.

        Usage:
          um_packing.wgdos_pack(field_in, mdi, accuracy)

        Args:
        * field_in - 2 Dimensional numpy.ndarray containing the field.
        * mdi      - Missing data indicator.
        * accuracy - Packing accuracy (power of 2).

        Returns:
          Byte-array/stream (suitable to write straight to file).

    um_packing.wgdos_unpack(...)
        Unpack UM field data which has been packed using WGDOS packing.

        Usage:
           um_packing.wgdos_unpack(bytes_in, mdi)

        Args:
        * bytes_in - Packed field byte-array.
        * mdi      - Missing data indicator.

        Returns:
          2 Dimensional numpy.ndarray containing the unpacked field.

    um_packing.get_um_version(...)
        Return the UM version number used to compile the library.

        Returns:
          String containing the UM version number.
