Mule User Guide
===============

**Who is this guide for?**

This guide is designed for a *user* of the Mule API.  It will aim to cover the
practical usage of the API, only explaining internal details where absolutely
necessary.

If you are looking for a guide to *developing* the API, or find this guide
does not go into sufficient technical detail, you may want to take a look at 
the developer guide.

**A tour of Mule by example**

This guide to getting started is intended to be relatively interactive, you
should be able to follow along in a python session and try out the examples 
for yourself.
